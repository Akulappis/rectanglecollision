1.  Folder 1 contains JavaScript file with plain alogorithmic solution for comparing if two rectangles overlap. 
2.  Folder 2 contains ready solution for demo purposes about the functionality of the function from folder 1.
3.  Algorithm gets two rectable objects as parameters. Each object contains rectangles upper left corners x-position, upper left corners y-position, width and height. Algorithm then transforms those objects into objects that have rectangles left, right, top and bottom edge values calculated. Those values are then compared to each other to determine wether those two rectangles intersect with each other.


Linked jsfiddle contains demo of the solution from folder 2. Demo from jsfiddle can be run by clicking the compare button on the top of the screen. If the rectangles do intersect, paragraph under compare button says true and if they don't, it says false.
